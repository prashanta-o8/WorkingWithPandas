# Pandas Tutorial and Kaggle Course Work
This repository contains my code implementations and practice exercises from various sources related to learning Pandas, including the tutorials by Corey Schafer on YouTube and the Kaggle Pandas course.

## Contents
1. **Corey Schafer's Pandas Tutorial**: 
    - This directory contains Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks where I followed along with Corey Schafer's Pandas tutorial series on YouTube.
    
2. **Kaggle Course Work**:
    - This directory contains my solutions and practice code from the Pandas course on Kaggle.

## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you will need:
- Python installed on your machine
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running .ipynb files)
- Pandas library installed (you can install it via pip: `pip install pandas`)
